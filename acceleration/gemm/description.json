		  "placed on each Super Logic Region (SLR) component of the targeted KU115 device. The two kernels can be deployed simultaneously on disjoint input matrices.",
		  "Each kernel has a systolic array of 2048 DSP units and is attached to two DDR banks. The DSP array runs at 400 MHz whereas the logic around the array runs at 300 MHz.",
		  "A variation of the GEMM kernel operates on int8 data points, performing twice as many multiplication and accumulation per cycle, effectively doubling the number of operations and throughput. ",
