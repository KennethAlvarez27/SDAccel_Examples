SDAccel Example Repository
===========================

Welcome to the SDAccel example repository. This repository contains the latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting Xilinx PCIe FPGA acceleration boards. All examples are ready to be compiled and executed on SDAccel supported boards and accelerated cloud service partners. The repository is organized as follows:

1. PREREQUISITE
2. GETTINGS STARTED
3. ACCELERATION
4. VISION
5. LIBS
6. UTILITY
7. OTHER INFORMATION
8. SUPPORT


### 1. PREREQUISITE

SDAccel Git Examples Assumes that user is familiar with Basic SDAccel Environment, Setup, Programming and Debugging Flow. If not, it is recommended to cover these topics from [SDAccel User Guides][]:
 - UG1238 - SDAccel Development Environment
 - UG1277 - SDAccel Programming Guide
 - UG1281 - SDAccel Debugging Guide

### 2. GETTING STARTED

Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use different features of SDAccel and start on their own application.

It is primarily recommended to start with [Hello World][] example which makes the new users aware about the basic structure of an SDAccel based Application. 

### 3. ACCELERATION

Collection of examples in processor offloading to FPGA based compute units.

### 4. VISION

Collection of examples in image and video processing. 

### 5. LIBS

Collection of common libraries used across all examples to assist in the quick development of application host code. 

### 6. UTILITY

Collection of utility functions used as part of the Makefiles in all of the examples. This set includes Makefile rules and scripts to launch SDAccel compiled applications onto boards hosted by Nimbix directly from the developers terminal shell.
