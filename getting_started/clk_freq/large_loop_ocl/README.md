Clock Frequency ~ Large Loop Count (CL) 
======================

This is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based example which mainly focuses on Convolution operation of a CNN network. The goal of this example is to demonstrate a method to overcome kernel design timing failure issue. It also presents the effectiveness of using multiple compute units to improve performance.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Clock Frequency, Multiple Compute Units, Convolutional Neural Networks

***KEYWORDS:*** xcl_array_partition, xcl_pipeline_loop, always_inline

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/cnn_convolution.cl
src/cnn_convolution_bad.cl
src/defns.h
src/host.cpp
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./host <cnn_GOOD XCLBIN> <cnn_BAD XCLBIN>
```
