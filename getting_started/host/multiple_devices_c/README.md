Multiple FPGA Devices Execution Concurrently (C)
======================

This example show how to take advantage of multiple FPGAs on a system. It will show how to initialized an OpenCL context, allocate memory on the two devices and execute a kernel on each FPGA.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** OpenCL API, Multi-FPGA Execution, Event Handling

***KEYWORDS:*** cl_device_id, clGetDeviceIDs()
