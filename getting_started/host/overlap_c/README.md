Overlap Host and HLS kernels (C)
======================

This examples demonstrates techniques that allow user to overlap Host(CPU) and FPGA computation in an application. It will cover asynchronous operations and event object.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** OpenCL API, Synchronize Host and FPGA, Asynchronous Processing, Events, Asynchronous memcpy

***KEYWORDS:*** cl_event, clCreateCommandQueue, CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE, clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects
