Blocking Pipes Example 
======================

# Overview
This is simple example of vector addition to demonstrate OpenCL Pipe Memory usage. OpenCL PIPE memory functionality allows user to achieve kernel-to-kernel data transfer without using global memory.

# Key Concepts
    - Dataflow
    - Kernel to Kernel pipes

# Keywords
    - pipe
    - xcl_reqd_pipe_depth
    - read_pipe_block()
    - write_pipe_block()
