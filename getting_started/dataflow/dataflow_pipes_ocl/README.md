Blocking Pipes (CL)
======================

This is simple example of vector addition to demonstrate OpenCL Pipe Memory usage. OpenCL PIPE memory functionality allows user to achieve kernel-to-kernel data transfer without using global memory.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Dataflow, kernel to kernel pipes

***KEYWORDS:*** pipe, xcl_reqd_pipe_depth, read_pipe_block(), write_pipe_block()
